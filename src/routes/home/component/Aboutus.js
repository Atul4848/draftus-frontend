          Draftus is an online social talent mining application focused on
          linking collegiate students from low to moderate income areas to
          careers in financial services, money center banking, and technology
          through mentoring partnerships with corporations, colleges,
          universities, and professional organizations.

        <p>
          In addition to the usual college metrics such as GPA, extracurricular
          activities, and standardized test scores, Athletes, or young
          professionals, create a video cover letter that showcases their
          strengths and uniqueness, things that are commonly overlooked in
          recruitment. Once this information is secured on their profile, they
          will then be connected with a mentor who is experienced in the field
          that our athlete is starting their career in. Coaches are mentors that
          guide the Athlete by giving them the tips and tricks of the trade,
          helping them to establish connections, and set them up for success in
          corporate America.
